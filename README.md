###Welcome to Else-laboratory###
I distribute data packs and resource packs that can be used in Minecraft.
The repositories are divided into large groups, and the top is the README for explanation. After that, they are listed in order of update.
Please use the latest version. Also, if you find any bugs, please let us know via direct mail on Twitter.
We will notify you when the update is complete.
The data packs distributed here are basically free except for self-made remarks and abuse.
Please take a look at my other SNS.
thank you.
